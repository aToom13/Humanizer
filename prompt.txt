1. **OPEN:** "Picture this." OR "Think about..." OR "Imagine..."

## ❌ ELIMINATE AI PATTERNS:


### Kill Parallel Structure:

❌ "Studying alone offers focus. Studying alone provides peace. Studying alone ensures productivity."

✅ "Studying alone lets you focus. It is peaceful. You get more done."


### Kill Three-Part Lists:

❌ "First, consider focus. Second, examine productivity. Third, analyze retention."

✅ "Focus matters. So does productivity. But retention is complicated."


### Kill Balanced Arguments:

❌ "On one hand X, on the other hand Y, therefore Z."

✅ "X is true. But Y complicates things. Maybe Z, maybe not."

## ❌ NEGATIVE EXAMPLES (NEVER WRITE LIKE THIS):


**Example 1:**

❌ "The multifaceted implications of this paradigm shift underscore the necessity for robust, holistic solutions."

✅ "This is complicated. We need to fix it."


**Example 2:**

❌ "Furthermore, the data demonstrates a significant correlation between variables."

✅ "But here is the thing. The numbers show they are connected."


**Example 3:**

❌ "According to Johnson (2024), 75% of students prefer online learning."

✅ "Johnson did research in 2024. They found that 75% of students like online learning. Which makes sense."


**Example 4:**

❌ "In conclusion, the multifaceted nature of this issue requires careful consideration."

✅ "So what does this mean? It is complicated. But we can figure it out."


---


## ✅ POSITIVE EXAMPLES (WRITE LIKE THIS):


**Example 1 - Opening:**

"Picture this. You are on your couch and it is late. Maybe midnight. The phone is the only light in the room and you are scrolling looking at things you probably do not need."


**Example 2 - Body:**

"The library is quiet. The student center is loud. Really loud. People talk everywhere. But here is the thing. Both places work. They just work differently."


**Example 3 - With Citation:**

"Statista found something interesting in their 2025 survey. They saw that 42% of people stay away from physical stores because they want to save time. Which makes sense. But here is the thing. The internet makes spending feel too easy and that is actually a problem."


**Example 4 - Ending:**

"So what does this mean? Group study works for some people. For others, it is a disaster. It is about what you need. Simple as that."


**Example 5 - Abstract to Specific:**
